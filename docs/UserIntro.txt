Hello, my name is Andy Turner.
This is the first of a series of short videos to introduce a computer program called MXG.
I led the development of MXG in the first few months of 2024.
The project was funded by The UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and was undertaken by the University of Leeds where I am employes as a research software engineer.

MXG is free and open source software to assist in creating, editing and visualising MESMER program data.
MESMER being the Master Equation Solver for Multi Energy-well Reactions.
A free and open source software for chemistry gas phase reaction kinetics.
MESMER inputs and outputs data in a standardised XML format. XML being eXtensible Markup Language.
MXG provides a Graphical User Interface - a GUI - to assist in creating, editing and visualising MESMER input and output data.
So the name MXG is an abbreviation of MESMER, XML and GUI.

This video has 3 parts:
First, I use a version of MXG served out by GitHub pages to load a MESMER input file, make some changes and create a new file.
The new file is compared with the original input file.
Second, I show how to install MXG as a progressive web app on Windows 10 using the Chrome Web browser.
Thirdly, we use the installed version to load another MESMER input file and look at a molecule visualisation.

Onto Part 1.
